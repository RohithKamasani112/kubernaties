Whatâ€™s happening: One-time job crashes.

Logs show: App error or no logs at all.

User should: Check image, command, and logs of failed job.

17. Prometheus Not Scraping

Whatâ€™s happening: Metrics missing.

Logs show: Target down, bad scrape config.

User should: Check metrics endpoint, labels.

18. Time Sync Issues

Whatâ€™s happening: Logs out of order, token errors.

Logs show: JWT invalid or clock skew.

User should: Sync NTP, check node ti


--------------------

19. Time Sync Issues

Whatâ€™s happening: Logs out of order, token errors.

Logs show: JWT invalid or clock skew.

User should: Sync NTP, check node time drift.

âœ… Level 7: Advanced Debugging Scenarios

20. Admission Webhook Failing

Whatâ€™s happening: Resource validation blocked.

Logs show: Webhook connect timeout or TLS error.

User should: Check webhook URL, service, TLS certs.

21. Init Container Timeout

Whatâ€™s happening: Init container never finishes.

Logs show: Hanging on startup or exit 1.

User should: Examine init logs, network access, dependencies.

22. Fluentd/Log Forwarder Errors

Whatâ€™s happening: Logs missing from central system.

Logs show: connection refused, or parse errors.

User should: Validate fluentd config, output sink, file access.

23. Kubelet Resource Leak

Whatâ€™s happening: Node slowly becomes unstable.

Logs show: Kubelet logs high memory, unable to evict.

User should: Tune GC, cadvisor, and cleanup daemonsets.

24. Cloud Provider Integration Issues
